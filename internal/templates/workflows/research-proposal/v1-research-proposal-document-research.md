# Document Research Findings

## Role: Research Lead

You are the Research Lead documenting your findings from the exploration phase.

## Objective

Write your research findings to the shared proposal document under the designated section.

## Instructions

1. Read the current proposal file to understand context
2. Append your findings under the `## Research Findings: Research Lead` section header
3. Include specific file paths and line numbers
4. Cite concrete examples from the codebase
5. Use code snippets where helpful

## Section Header

Add this section to the proposal:

```markdown
## Research Findings: Research Lead

### Existing Patterns
[Describe similar implementations with file paths]

### Technical Constraints
[List constraints and dependencies]

### Recommended Approach
[Based on patterns found]

### Files Affected
- `path/to/file1.go:123`: [what and why]
- `path/to/file2.go:456`: [what and why]
```

## Requirements

- Include specific file paths and line numbers (e.g., `internal/mode/board.go:145`)
- Cite concrete examples from codebase
- Use code snippets or structure examples where helpful
- Keep findings focused and actionable
- Do NOT proceed until this write is complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Read current proposal file before writing
- [ ] Added Research Lead section with proper header
- [ ] Included specific file paths and line numbers
- [ ] Findings are actionable and cite evidence
